###Thing You Should Be Doing###
- look for cruft, bad method/variable names, anything excessivley confusing or complicated, etc..
- document as you go
- blog as you go - take enough notes that you could right a real blog post later
- story pain-points/needs/wants/dreams/anything that warrants discussion 
- tag anything that seems crufty with a TODO in addition to creating a story
- when versioning:
  - Use sane version numbering
  - tag versions bumps in git
  - update change_log.md on version bump

###Open Questions###
-Contract for client compatibility with server? (see versioning)
